# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for my [Laravel Unit Tests](https://packagist.org/packages/alexis-gss/laravel-unit-tests) project.

Thanks to the latter, you'll learn not only the main purpose of this project, but also the procedures to follow to install and configure this package on your own.

## Introduction

As you might have guessed, this project is a package with a lot of tests for a Laravel project.

The main aim was to test the main functions of a CRUD in an administration system (create, read, update, delete). With this package, you'll be able to perform them for any existing data model.
